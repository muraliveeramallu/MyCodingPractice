
Transform One String to Another using Minimum Number of Given Operation
 

Given two strings A and B, the task is to convert A to B if possible. The only operation allowed is to put any character from A and insert it at front. Find if it’s possible to convert the string. If yes, then output minimum no. of operations required for transformation.
Input:  A = "ABD", B = "BAD"
Output: 1
Explanation: Pick B and insert it at front.

Input:  A = "EACBD", B = "EABCD"
Output: 3
Explanation: Pick B and insert at front, EACBD => BEACD
             Pick A and insert at front, BEACD => ABECD
             Pick E and insert at front, ABECD => EABCD
